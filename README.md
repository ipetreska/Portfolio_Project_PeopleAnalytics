# Portfolio_Project_PeopleAnalytics: To showcase my skillset in data wrangling, EDA, & talent insights generation for HR Stakeholders in R 

#STEP 1: Cleaning/Merging/Data Wrangling. I used the following AI prompt:
#"You are a data scientist working in R. Using the attached datasets:
1.	Clean each dataset:
    • Remove duplicate rows
    • Replace missing values (NA or blanks) in numeric columns with column averages
2.	Merge the datasets based on a common key (e.g., Employee_ID)
Return the cleaned, merged dataset.

#STEP 2: I downloaded the merged dataset titled "Cleaned_Merged_Dataset" 

#STEP 3: I uploaded the cleaned & merged dataset titled "Cleaned_Merged_Dataset" into R 

#STEP 4: I loaded packages & performed analysis, created vizualizations in R  (see code repository)
